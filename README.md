# Testing BERT LLM and Its Fine-Tuning

This repository contains the code and resources necessary for testing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as a large language model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on a specific downstream task. We will explore how BERT can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Overview

BERT is a pre-trained transformer model designed for understanding bidirectional context in text. This project demonstrates:
- How to load a pre-trained BERT model
- Fine-tuning the BERT model on custom datasets
- Evaluating its performance on downstream tasks

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this project, ensure you have the following:

- A Python environment (Python 3.7+ recommended)
- Access to a GPU for faster model training (optional but recommended)
- The following libraries installed:
  - `transformers` by Hugging Face
  - `torch` for PyTorch-based implementation
  - `datasets` for dataset management
  - `scikit-learn` for performance evaluation
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling
- Basic understanding of BERT and NLP tasks
- Dataset prepared for fine-tuning (e.g., text classification, question answering)

## Setup

To set up the environment and install necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets scikit-learn pandas numpy
